## Key features


**Data privacy** - Nanocell-csv works 100% off-line, your data is never leaving your computer. Nanocell-csv.com runs on a static server which, by design, only sends data on request but cannot register any data. This is very easy for the anyone to validate as the source code is available [here](https://github.com/CedricBonjour/nanocell-csv).

**Data accuracy** - CSV data is text and Nanocell-csv makes sure values are being handled as such. Leading zeros and '+' signs are kept. No more data corruption of phone numbers, zipcodes, etc. Pasting data also finally works as you would expect, no more paste reformatting or column split action to perform !

**Instant view large files** - O(1) ðŸ˜‰. This is achieved by sampling the header, the footer and a few rows at regular intervals without parsing the entire file. The goal here is for data experts to quickly understand what they are dealing with when first opening a file. That is before they start using heavier Big-Data tools like pandas, pyspark, powerBI, R etc...
